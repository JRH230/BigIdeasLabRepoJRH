# BigIdeasLabRepoJRH
Our programs asks the user for their name, and for them to input their hair color. Whatever they input gets capitalized.
Our group has James Hathaway and Elliott Finney

## What it does:
   - This program grabs the user's name and hair color and then returns their hair color in all caps

## How to use it:
   - Run the code using the installation directions below and then type in your answers to the questions about yourself, then press shift+enter to run it.

## How to install it:
   - I don't know how to run JupyterLabs natively, but if you got to Pitt you can download it and upload it to JupyterLabs and run it by clicking the code block and pressing shift+enter. To do this natively, you can use Binder.

## How to contribute:
   - If you want to contribute, first you can fork the repo and then add your changes, since this is a school project you can do whatever you want to. Then if you'd like us to take a look at them, make a pull request and we might apply them.
