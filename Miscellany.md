## Our Description and Mindset

While picking our license, a few things were considered. The first one, obviously, was ease of access. MIT's open source software license is easy for 
everyone to understand, as it is ultimately just one paragraph describing the rights of the project and what is and is not allowed to be done with 
it. Because of this, MIT's license was an early candidate. Also, we agree with the ideology that comes with using this license, as it encourages
the use of open source software and allowing others to have access to it. By following this philosophy, it encourages all members of the programming world
to be active learners and to help eachother out by checking eachothers work, similar to how scientists compare scientific journals. For the code of conduct,
we chose one that outlined restrictive, but fair limitations. Essentially, we want to encourage proper use of our program, while also ensuring that it is
used in a respectful manner and to further academic progress.
